## Sample

```
In 2019 Los Angeles, former police officer Rick Deckard is detained
by officer Gaff, and brought to his former supervisor, Bryant.
Deckard, whose job as a "blade runner" was to track down
bioengineered beings known as replicants and "retire" (kill) them,
is informed that four are on Earth illegally. Deckard starts to
leave, but Bryant ambiguously threatens him, and he stays. The two
watch a video of a blade runner named Holden administering the
"Voigt-Kampff" test, which is designed to distinguish replicants
from humans based on their emotional response to questions. The
test subject, Leon, shoots Holden on the second question. Bryant
wants Deckard to retire Leon and the other three Tyrell Corporation
Nexus-6 replicants: Roy Batty, Zhora, and Pris.
